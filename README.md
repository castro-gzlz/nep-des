## Installation and usage

**You do not need to install anything**. You can simply **clone** or **download** the repository and run all cells of the [nep_des.ipynb]() file. The code is very **straightforward** and **intuitive** to use, so it does not have detailed documentation. If you find any problem or would like to propose an update do not hesitate to [drop me an issue](https://github.com/castro-gzlz/nep-des/issues), make a [pull request](https://github.com/castro-gzlz/nep-des/pulls), or contact me at [acastro@cab.inta-csic.es](acastro@cab.inta-csic.es).
