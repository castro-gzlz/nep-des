# **nep-des**
This code generates **period–radius diagrams** with the **population-based boundaries** of the **Neptunian desert**, **ridge**, and **savanna**, as derived in [Castro-González et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...689A.250C/abstract). It also generates two-column plots with the **density trend** for super-Neptune and sub-Jovian planets identified in [Castro-González et al. (2024b)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...691A.233C/abstract).

## Installation and Usage

No installation is required. Simply **clone** or **download** this repository and run [`nep_des.ipynb`](https://github.com/castro-gzlz/nep-des/blob/main/nep_des.ipynb). You only need to adapt the [User configuration](nep_des.ipynb#user-configuration) section, run the (collapsed) cells in the **main code block**, and then execute any of the **three plotting cells**. In the following, we show five example use cases covering the three types of diagrams generated by *nep-des*. The corresponding configuration cells for each example can be found in [this file](aux/config_examples.ipynb).

## 1. The exo-Neptunian landscape (desert, ridge, and savanna)

In the left panel ([example #1](aux/config_examples.ipynb)), we contextualize several unusually short-period planets located within the core of the Neptunian desert. In the right panel ([example #2](aux/config_examples.ipynb)), we place a sub-Saturn within the broader exo-Neptunian landscape (desert, ridge, and savanna) and highlight it with a text box.

## 2. The super-Neptune / sub-Jovian density trend

## Caution

The contour map represents the **observed** density of planets in the selected catalogue, which is subjected to different **observational** and **selection** **biases**, and hence it **does not represent** the *true planet occurrence* from which the boundaries were derived. We note, however, that there is a quite good (visual) agreement between the observed distribution and the population-based boundaries so it is reasonable to plot them together for visualization purposes.
