# **nep-des**
This [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) creates **period-radius diagrams** with the **population-based boundaries** of the Neptunian **desert**, **ridge**, and **savanna** derived in [Castro-González et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...689A.250C/abstract).

## Installation and usage

**You do not need to install anything**. You can simply **clone** or **download** the repository and run all cells of the [nep_des.ipynb]() file. The code is very **straightforward** and **intuitive** to use, so it does not have detailed documentation. If you find any problem or would like to propose an update do not hesitate to [drop me an issue](https://github.com/castro-gzlz/nep-des/issues), make a [pull request](https://github.com/castro-gzlz/nep-des/pulls), or contact me at [acastro@cab.inta-csic.es](acastro@cab.inta-csic.es).

## Output example

In the left panel, we contextualize some of the most well-known and rare planets in the middle of the Neptunian desert: TOI-849 b ([Armstrong et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Natur.583...39A/abstract)), TOI-1853 b ([Naponiello et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023Natur.622..255N/abstract)), LTT 9779 b ([Jenkins et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatAs...4.1148J/abstract)), TOI-3071 b ([Hacker et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.532.1612H/abstract)), TOI-674 b ([Murgas et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...653A..60M/abstract)), and K2-45 b ([Crossfield et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..226....7C/abstract)). For this plot, we used the NASA Exoplanet Archive catalogue. 

In the right panel, we contextualize a planet in the Neptunian savanna, HATS-17 b ([Brahm et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151...89B/abstract)), and highlight it with a text box instead of in the legend. The same can be done for many planets. For this plot, we used the Exoplanet.eu catalogue. The planetS catalog for planets with precise mass and radii can be also used.
