### Note
A Python script (and a Jupyter notebook) to easily contextualize your favourite planets with the population-based boundaries of the Neptunian desert, ridge, and savanna derived in Castro-González et al. (2024) will be released on **Friday 20th of September** in this repository. Stay tuned :-D
