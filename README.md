# **nep-des**
This [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) creates **period-radius diagrams** with the **population-based boundaries** of the Neptunian **desert**, **ridge**, and **savanna** derived in [Castro-González et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...689A.250C/abstract).

## Installation and usage

**You do not need to install anything**. You can simply **clone** or **download** the repository and run all cells of the [nep_des.ipynb](https://github.com/castro-gzlz/nep-des/blob/main/nep_des.ipynb) file. The code is very **straightforward** and **intuitive** to use, so it does not have detailed documentation. If you find any problem or would like to propose an update do not hesitate to [drop me an issue](https://github.com/castro-gzlz/nep-des/issues), make a [pull request](https://github.com/castro-gzlz/nep-des/pulls), or contact me at [amadeo.castro-gonzalez@unige.ch](amadeo.castro-gonzalez@unige.ch).

## Output example

In the left panel, we contextualize some of the best-known planets located in the middle of the Neptunian desert: TOI-849 b ([Armstrong et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Natur.583...39A/abstract)), TOI-1853 b ([Naponiello et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023Natur.622..255N/abstract)), LTT 9779 b ([Jenkins et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatAs...4.1148J/abstract)), TOI-3071 b ([Hacker et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.532.1612H/abstract)), TOI-674 b ([Murgas et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...653A..60M/abstract)), and K2-45 b ([Crossfield et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..226....7C/abstract)). 

In the right panel, we contextualize the planet HATS-17 b ([Brahm et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151...89B/abstract)) within the exo-Neptunian landscape and highlight it with a text box. Additional planets can be depicted in the same way.

In the left-hand plot, we used the *NASA Exoplanet Archive* catalogue, and in the right-hand plot, we used the *Exoplanet.eu* catalogue. The *planetS* catalogue for planets with precise masses and radii can also be used.

## Caution

The contour map represents the **observed** density of planets in the selected catalogue, which is subjected to different **observational** and **selection** **biases**, and hence it **does not represent** the *true planet occurrence* from which the boundaries were derived. We note, however, that there is a quite good (visual) agreement between the observed distribution and the population-based boundaries so it is reasonable to plot them together for visualization purposes.
