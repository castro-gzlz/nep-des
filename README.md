# **nep-des**
This code generates **period–radius diagrams** with the **population-based boundaries** of the **Neptunian desert**, **ridge**, and **savanna**, as derived in [Castro-González et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...689A.250C/abstract). It also generates two-column plots with the **density trend** for super-Neptune and sub-Jovian planets identified in [Castro-González et al. (2024b)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...691A.233C/abstract).

## Installation and Usage

No installation is required. Simply **clone** or **download** this repository and run [`nep_des.ipynb`](https://github.com/castro-gzlz/nep-des/blob/main/nep_des.ipynb). You only need to adapt the [User configuration](nep_des.ipynb#user-configuration) section, run the (collapsed) cells in the **main code block**, and then execute any of the **three plotting cells**. In the following, we show five example use cases covering the three types of diagrams generated by *nep-des*. The corresponding configuration cells for each example can be found in [this file](aux/config_examples.ipynb).

## 1. The exo-Neptunian landscape (desert, ridge, and savanna)

In the left panel ([example #1](aux/config_examples.ipynb)), we contextualize several unusually short-period planets located within the core of the Neptunian desert. In the right panel ([example #2](aux/config_examples.ipynb)), we place a sub-Saturn within the broader exo-Neptunian landscape (desert, ridge, and savanna) and highlight it with a text box.

## 2. The super-Neptune / sub-Jovian density trend

In this two-panel plot ([example #3](aux/config_examples.ipynb)), we contextualize several planets along the **density trend for super-Neptune and sub-Jovian planets** identified in [Castro-González et al. (2024b)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...691A.233C/abstract). Planets in the savanna exhibit low densities, typically below 1 g/cm³, whereas those in the ridge and desert can reach densities of 2 g/cm³ or higher. Remarkably, the density transition aligns closely with the observed planet-occurrence break between the ridge and the savanna (around ~6 days), suggesting that **desert and ridge planets may share a common formation or evolutionary pathway distinct from that of Neptunes in the savanna** (see the referenced papers for further discussions).

This plotting option also uses an MCMC approach to assess the significance of the trend. At present, without including the (duplicated) user-plotted planets (`include_user_planets_in_density_stats = False`):

We obtain a KS p-value of 0.0065 for the (DESERT + RIDGE) vs. SAVANNA comparison, which is slightly lower than the originally published value (KS p-value = 0.0092; [Castro-González et al. 2024b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...691A.233C/abstract)). This significant result shows that **the density distributions of the desert/ridge and savanna are different**. Remarkably, **there is no evidence of a density difference between the desert and ridge planets** (p-value = 0.27), which is somewhat expected given the very small desert sample (N_desert = 6). Still, the Cliff's delta remains high (0.38), which suggests a potentially meaningful effect that current sample sizes are not sufficient to confirm. In this line, we note that relatively low-density super-Neptunes exist in the ridge but not in the desert—an intriguing feature consistent with the proposed **density brink** ([Bourrier et al. 2025](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...701A.190B/abstract)).

## Note on the landscape plots

The contour map represents the **observed** density of planets in the selected catalogue, which is subjected to different **observational** and **selection** **biases**, and hence it **does not represent** the *true planet occurrence* from which the boundaries were derived. We note, however, that there is a quite good (visual) agreement between the observed distribution and the population-based boundaries so it is reasonable to plot them together for visualization purposes.
